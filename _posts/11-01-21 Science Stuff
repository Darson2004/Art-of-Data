The null hypothesis is that the grapehen created material proved to be as good as a sensor as a room temperature 
sensor for harmful and poisonous carbon-monoxide gas. The alternative hypothesis states th graphene sensor would 
be a poor carbon monoxide sensor. The scientists collecting the data were Dipankar Panda, Anupam Nandi, Swapan K. 
Datta, Hiranmay Sahaa, and Sanhita Majumdar. The datasets, which are not all available to the public, use an AFM 
microscope and spectra graphs. This research is interesting because the new material is created from carbon and 
pollution free materials and the graphene has great conductivity and large surface area. Using the pictures 
available to the public, the absorbance of light was graphed by the wavelength and the AFM microscope graphed the 
height and position of a picture taken. However, given we cannot see the entire paper, we cannot tell what is
exactly left out. They backed their conclusion with the data from the pictures, and related the graphene sensor 
to the room temperature sensor. It is not listed how the article was funded, though it can be assumed the journal
or the affiliated university/laboratory funded the research. Personally, I do not think the paper was influenced 
by publish or perish given the single-blind reviewing. However, it also could be there was around a month and a
half to wait to get publsished when the usual time to get published is around 6 months to a year.
