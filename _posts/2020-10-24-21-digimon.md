# Process
I worked with Tuhin Ghosh, Elias Romero, and Bulyn Panjamapirom.

For me, the first question was relatively easy. All I did was add all the speed up into one variable, count the number of digimon, and then divide the total speed by the number of digimon. However, the second was harder. At first, I did not even think about using a function. At first, I made many for loops to run through and count all the possible headers and headingtypes. However, with Tuhin and Elias, and a better way to picture the idea, I made a function count_digimon:
``` Python

def count_digimon(header, headerType): #Define a function with a random header and headerType
    digimonCounter = 0 #To count the number of Digimon with the specific headerType
    for Digimon in data: 
        digimonAttr = Digimon[header] #the variable digimonAttr is equal to the header the user enters in. In this case, Attribute
        if digimonAttr == headerType: #we check if the digimonAttr is equal to the specific headerType and add 1 to a counter if it is
            digimonCounter += 1

```
The code essentially first runs through each header the user types in, then each of the haeding types. For example, if the user typed "Stage" as the heading, there are many heading types, like "Champion", "Baby", "Rookie"... 
Once we find all the desired heading types, we count it into our digimon counter so it returns the number of digimon with the desired heading type.

The third question was the most interesting. I mainly worked with Elias, though Tuhin did map out how we should code it. Elias and I worked together to write the code for a dictionary wehre we put digimon into the dictionary and determined their memory and attack.
``` Python

groupof3 = [] #making a dictionary called groupof3 for the group of three that has either at least 15 memory or 300 attack
#There are 3 slots in the groupof3, the first slot, second slot, and third. We can name the digimon by their slots.
#The first slot only changes when the second slot goes through the entire csv file and returns to its starting number. 
#The second slot changes when the third slot goes through the entire csv file and returns to its original number.
#Once the third slot returns to its starting number, the second number is increased by 1 and the third slot also has to increase by one.
#for example, lets say the slots had Kuramon, Pabumon, and Punimon. Once the third slot returns to Punimon. The second slot goes to Punimon 
# and the third slot goes to the digimon after Puinimon, which is Botamon.
for Digimon1 in data:  
    memory1 = int(Digimon1["Memory"])     
    attack1 = int(Digimon1["Atk"])
    for Digimon2 in data:
        memory2 = int(Digimon2["Memory"]) 
        attack2 = int(Digimon2["Atk"])
        for Digimon3 in data:
            memory3 = int(Digimon3["Memory"])
            attack3 = int(Digimon3["Atk"])  

```
So my code is not super clunky, I removed that large comment from the actual code, so it is an explanation here. 

In conclusion, I learned that dictionaries can be used to answer nearly any question given a csv file. I think the mathematics to add the headings and heading types, was very easy to visualize for me, and working on makign functions and nested for loops would be good for future labs.
